Interdomain Routing:
	Interdomain routing set MEDs
	Interdomain routing dealing with unknown locations
	Conversion from product graph to regex for preferences on border routers

Aggregation:
	Adding aggregation constaints
	Checking aggregation never black holdes according to k failure scenario
	Automatically insert aggregation when ok

Well-formedness:
	Ensure topology is well formed (connected)
	Reject routes not matching out* in+ out*
	Disallow aggregation on external locations
	Deal with regexes with locations that don't match topology

Other:
	Infer which routers we care about in the product graph based on policy
	Generalize syntax in parser for better error messages
	More detailed counterexamples (include exact failure scenario)


Performance:
	Use mutable data structures instead of Set, Map, etc
	Allow specifying speed/expressiveness of policies allowed (e.g., change which nodes to remove in simulation based on this)
