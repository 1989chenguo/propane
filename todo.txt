Issues:
  - Aggregation can leak local prefixes (lint?) 
  - Aggregation can be filtered

Features:
  - Add syntax for building ranges of ASes (e.g., as[101-500])
  - add syntax + support for IP V6
  - Concrete failure scenario for counterexample

Refactoring:
  - Clean up testing from command line flag to proper environment

Nice to have:
  - When preferences can be equal, don't force an ordering (helps multipath)

Abstract Analysis:
  - Perform substitution at the ABGP-level for each router to concretize
  - Allow translation of templates to Router level rather than ABGP level
  - Pigeon-hole inference rule(s) for k-paths. Is this needed?
  - Existential constraints help pods + DCell
  - Benchmarks!!!

Future Ideas
  - Automatically abstract topology for concrete networks using these mechanisms
      * Speed up compilation
      * Generate a set of templates
  - Synthesize OSPF configurations, or iBGP, or both
  - Ensure at least k paths between routers
      * Requires analysis of the PGIR
      * Can leverage k disjoint paths abstract interpretation
