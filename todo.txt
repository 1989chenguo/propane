Aggregation:
	Adding aggregation constaints
	Checking aggregation never black holdes according to k failure scenario
	Automatically insert aggregation when ok

Well-formedness:
	Ensure topology is well formed (connected)
	All peers in topology are known
	Reject routes not matching out* in+ out*
	Disallow aggregation on external locations

Error Reporting
	More detailed counterexamples (include exact failure scenario)

Misc
	Remove edges not on simple path efficiently
	paths for starting locations based on language emptiness
