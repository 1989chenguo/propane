Interdomain Routing:
	Interdomain routing set MEDs
	Interdomain routing dealing with unknown locations
	Conversion from product graph to regex for preferences on border routers

Aggregation:
	Adding aggregation constaints
	Checking aggregation never black holdes according to k failure scenario
	Automatically insert aggregation when ok

Well-formedness:
	Ensure topology is well formed (connected)
	Reject routes not matching out* in+ out*
	Disallow aggregation on external locations
	Deal with regexes with locations that don't match topology

Other:
	Dealing with multiple sinks for originating traffic
	Infer which routers we care about in the product graph based on policy
	More efficient BFS in constrained path problem
	Generalize syntax in parser for better error messages
	More detailed counterexamples (include exact failure scenario)


Performance:
	Dominated edges should be faster
	Avoid copying graph all the time (use bidirectional edges instead)
	Use mutable data structures instead of Set, Map, etc
	Allow specifying speed/expressiveness of policies allowed (e.g., change which nodes to remove in simulation based on this)
