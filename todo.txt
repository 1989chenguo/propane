  - Fix issue with MED, Prepending etc for Backbone example

Avoid duplicate constraints (do this at router level after expanding predicates)
Aggregation can leak local prefixes (lint?)
Concrete failure scenario for counterexample
add syntax for building ranges of ASes (e.g., as[101-500])
Reuse finding path code across Regex and CGraph modules

add syntax + support for IP V6
add syntax + support for different prefix matches (e.g., pfx[8..24], need BDD?)
