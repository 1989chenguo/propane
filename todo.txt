Issues:
  - Aggregation can leak local prefixes (lint?) 
  - Aggregation can be filtered
  - Avoid duplicate constraints (do this at router level after expanding predicates)
  - Warn when originating no-exact match

Features:
  - Add syntax for building ranges of ASes (e.g., as[101-500])
  - add syntax + support for IP V6
  - Concrete failure scenario for counterexample

Refactoring:
  - Clean up testing from command line flag to proper environment

Nice to have:
  - When preferences can be equal, don't force an ordering (helps multipath)
