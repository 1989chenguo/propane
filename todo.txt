Paper:	
	Add maxroutes constraints
	Add community tagging constraints
	Add delete community tagging constraints
	Add allow private AS, etc
	
	Add lexical scoping operator
	Lift preferences to top level
	Define new predicates: never, only, prefLocs, startIn, etc

Correctness
	Remove edges not on simple path efficiently

Aggregation:
	Adding aggregation constaints
	Checking aggregation never black holdes according to k failure scenario
	Automatically insert aggregation when ok

Well-formedness:
	Disallow aggregation on external locations
	Ensure no recursive definitions



/* after paper */

Error Reporting
	More detailed counterexamples (include exact failure scenario)

Misc
	Line numbers for parse errors caught later
