what to do about the default catch-all for each block?
	- difference between allow/any/end(out)
	

Concrete failure scenario for counterexample
Fix issue with MED, Prepending etc for Backbone example
Issue with avoid for external peers when going through out

Avoid duplicate constraints (do this at router level after expanding predicates)
add syntax for building ranges of ASes (e.g., as[101-500])
Reuse finding path code across Regex and CGraph modules
Can we do a better job avoiding garbage states when building the automaton
add syntax + support for IP V6
add syntax + support for different prefix matches (e.g., pfx[8..24])
