Big Items:
  - Issue with avoid for external peers when going through out
  - Fix issue with MED, Prepending etc for Backbone example

Avoid duplicate constraints (do this at router level after expanding predicates)
Aggregation can leak local prefixes (lint?)
Concrete failure scenario for counterexample
add syntax for building ranges of ASes (e.g., as[101-500])

add syntax + support for IP V6
add syntax + support for different prefix matches (e.g., pfx[8..24], need BDD?)

When preferences can be equal, don't force an ordering (helps multipath)
Allow preferences in constraints by using Regex.LazyT

Clean up testing from command line flag to proper environment
Multiple red "failure" printed in compilation tests
