Correctness
	Remove edges not on simple path efficiently
	+ paths for starting locations based on language emptiness

Aggregation:
	Adding aggregation constaints
	Checking aggregation never black holdes according to k failure scenario
	Automatically insert aggregation when ok

Well-formedness:
	+ Reject routes not matching out* in+ out*
	Disallow aggregation on external locations

Error Reporting
	More detailed counterexamples (include exact failure scenario)

Misc
	Line numbers for parse errors caught later
	Add difference as a high-level combinator
	More efficient character class ops for AvoidsAny, EndsAtAny, ...
