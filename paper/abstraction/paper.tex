%=====================================================


% Points to make
%
% (1) Lets operators think about topologies/policies at a high-level of abstraction
%     - matches current thinking (e.g., templates)
%
% (2) Promotes a correct-by-construction methodology
%
%     properties that hold over abstract topologies hold over concrete ones
%      - includes correct forwarding behavior
%      - includes reachability (under k-failures)
%
% (3) Enables reusability (e.g., across datacenters) and expansion (e.g., within a datacenter)
%
% (4) lets us scale synthesis to large-scale topologies


\textbf{Abstract---}
We develop techniques for automated reasoning about end-to-end properties of abstract network topologies. We extend a network synthesis tool, \sysname, to allow network operators to write a high-level routing policy over an abstraction of their network topology. From such a specification, \sysname synthesizes a collection router configurations running the distributed Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that are guaranteed to implement the centralized routing policy for any concrete instantiation of the abstract topology, and for any combination of network failures in the resulting concrete topology.
%
Additionally, properties proven by \sysname over the abstract topology, such as reachability between a source and destination under k-failures, are also guaranteed to hold under any concrete instantiation of the abstract topology.
%
Something something, expandable/incremental networks. Something something scales compilation to large networks. Something something, templates easier to understand.
%These strong guarantees allow operators to reason about the routing behavior of their network at a high-level abstraction, while also generating an efficient low-level implementation.
%
%In addition, operators are able to safely change or expand their network in any way, so long as the new resulting topology also respects the abstraction.
%
We test \sysname out on ... blah blah blah

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{easylist}[itemize]
& Network configuration is difficult/error-prone. Operators think of policy at
  a high level of abstraction, yet for implementations:
&& Often configs must be decomposed device-by-device
&& Often need to create reusable configurations for different topologies/policies
&& Ensure different devices/networks kept consistent when policy changes

& Current state of the art is to capture abstractions using parameterized
  device templates. The same templates can then be reused across multiple
  devices. Unfortunately, existing template systems have many limitations
&& Templates often still require the operator to reason about network-wide
   policy device-by-device.
&& Templates do not provide any guarantees of configuration correctness,
   instead requiring the operator to manually reason about forwarding for
   any possible concrete network
&&& In addition, operators must reason about possible network failures that
    might arise in one concrete network versus another

& To this end, we build a language called \sysname to simplify the operators task.
&& \sysname allows the operator to define high-level network abstractions to reflect
   the operator's mental model, and then to write a centralized routing policy over the
   abstraction.
&& We extend the \sysname intermediate graph-based representation to support abstract policies,
   and show how to compile abstract \sysname policies to this representation.
&& As a major use-case, we show how the compilation and failure-safety analysis
   of the Propane configuration-synthesis tool can be extended over abstract topologies.
&& We develop an abstract interpretation that operates over this graph representation and verifies
   if properties, such as reachability or k-disjoint paths between two nodes, are guaranteed
   to hold for any possible concrete instantiation of the network.
&& Our major result is an abstraction theorem, which states that ...
&& The result is that policies compiled with the Propane compiler to distributed configurations
   are guaranteed to have correct forwarding behavior for any possible concrete instantiation
   of the network, and for any possible combination of failures in the given concrete network.
&&& Finally, we show how abstract compilation makes it possible to dramatically speed up compilation
    time for the Propane policies, cite some numbers here ...

% Some useful citations from the previous paper listed below

%It is well known that configuring networks is error
%prone and that such errors can lead to disruptive
%downtimes~\cite{mahajan+:bgp-misconfiguration,feamster+:rcc,batfish,dc-failure-study}.
%For instance, a recent misconfiguration led to an hour-long, nation-wide outage for Time Warner's backbone network~\cite{time-warner}; and a major BGP-related incident makes international news every few months~\cite{bgpmon}.%

%A fundamental reason for the prevalence of misconfigurations is the
%semantic mismatch between the intended high-level
%policies and the low-level configurations.
%Many policies involve network-wide properties---prefer a certain neighbor,
%never announce a particular destination externally,
%use a particular path only if another fails---but configurations describe the behavior of
%individual devices.
%%
%Operators must manually decompose network-wide policy into
%device behaviors, such that policy-compliant behavior results from the distributed interactions of
%these devices.
%%
%Policy-compliance must be ensured not only under normal
%circumstances but also during failures.  The need to reason
%about all possible failures exacerbates the challenge
%for network operators.  As a result, configurations that work
%correctly in failure-free environments have nonetheless been found to violate key
%network-wide properties when failures occur~\cite{batfish}.%

%To reduce configuration errors, operators are increasingly adopting an
%approach in which common tasks are captured as parameterized templates~\cite{hatch,thwack}.
%%
%While templates help ensure certain kinds of consistency across devices,
%they do not provide fundamentally different abstractions from existing configuration languages
%or bridge the semantic divide between network-wide policies and device-level configuration.
%Thus, they still require operators to
%manually decompose policies into device behaviors.%

%As a complementary approach, configuration analysis tools can help reduce misconfigurations by checking if low-level configurations match high-level policy~\cite{batfish,feamster+:rcc}. However, such tools cannot help operators with the challenging task of generating configurations in the first place.%

%Software-defined networking (SDN) and its abstractions
%are, in part, the research
%community's response to the difficulty of maintaining policy
%compliance through distributed device interactions~\cite{ethane}.
%Instead of organizing networks around a distributed
%collection of devices that compute forwarding tables through
%mutual interactions, the devices are told how to
%forward packets by a centralized controller. The controller is responsible for ensuring that the
%paths taken are compliant with operator specifications.%

%The centralized control planes of SDN, however, are not a panacea.
%First, while many SDN programming systems~\cite{sdn-languages} provide effective \emph{intra}-domain routing
%abstractions, letting users specify paths within their network,
%they fail to provide a coherent means to specify \emph{inter}-domain routes.
%Second, centralized control planes
%require careful design and engineering to be robust to failures---one must ensure that all devices can communicate with the controller at all times, even under arbitrary failure combinations. Even ignoring failures, it is necessary for the control system to
%scale to meet the demands of large or geographically-distributed networks,
%and to react quickly
%to environmental changes. For this challenge, researchers are exploring
%multi-controller systems with interacting controllers, thus bringing back distributed
%control planes~\cite{mccauley2013extending,onos} and their current programming difficulties.%

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

\begin{figure}[t!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/example}
  \caption{An example data center network.}
  \label{fig:example}
  \vspace{-1em}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/example2}
  \caption{A modified version of the example in Figure~\ref{fig:example}.}
  \label{fig:example2}
  \vspace{-1em}
\end{figure}

We motivate \sysname using an example data center network adapted from prior work~\cite{propane}. Our network, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example}, is a standard folded-Clos topology with four pods. It has eight top-of-rack (ToR) switches, T[1--8]; eight aggregation switches, A[1--8]; and two spine switches, S[1--2]. Groups of addresses, P[1--8], are for services hosted in each rack. Such groups are called address {\em prefixes} because they are compactly encoded using the common prefix that addresses share.

The figure also shows the intended policy. Internal connectivity should be complete, i.e., all nodes must be able to talk to each other. Pods 1 and 2 host services that are meant to be globally accessible and thus their addresses should be announced externally, but only after the individual prefixes P[1--4] are aggregated into a single prefix PG. Finally, pods 3 and 4 host services that are not meant to be externally visible and thus their address should not be announced externally.

To correctly configure the policy above, the network engineer's task is to generate low-level configuration commands for each switch in the network. This implies making sure, for instance, that all switch interfaces are assigned correct addresses; all routing adjacencies are correctly configured (e.g., T1's configuration includes A1 as neighbor and vice-versa); all switches announce their own addresses (so that they can be reached for management purposes) and the ToRs announce the correct prefixes for their services; all switches  forward the prefix announcements that they should to each neighbor and not forward those that they should not (e.g., the spines should forward prefixes for local services to internal neighbors but not external neighbors); and the spines announce externally only the aggregate global prefix. As many have observed before, such configuration tasks are highly challenging and, consequently, configuration errors are the leading contributor to network outages~\cite{x,y,z,batfish,propane}.

\subsection{Challenges with today's template systems}

To reduce errors, the network engineering community is moving toward a template-based approach. Here, instead of authoring one configuration file per router, they author one configuration template per {\em role}, where each role is played by one or more routers.\footnote{If a role is played by devices from different vendors, there is one template per role-vendor combination because templates use vendor configuration language.} For instance, the network in Figure~\ref{fig:example} has five roles: spine, global aggregator, global ToR, local aggregator, and local ToR. Role templates have parameters for various aspects of the configuration (e.g., interface addresses, list of neighbors), and they are compiled to device configurations by instantiating the parameters using a database that stores parameter values for each device.

Templates provide two key advantages. First, they help eliminate a class of configuration errors that stem from typos and inconsistencies, e.g., using the wrong address for a switch, having inconsistent addresses for the two ends of a link, and failing to configure one side of a routing adjacency.  Second, templates have the potential for re-use when the topology changes while maintaining its basic structure (e.g., adding a new pod to the data center) or multiple networks with similar structures need to be instantiated (e.g., in an organization that runs multiple data centers).

%Second, the engineers need to author and reason about fewer independent ``files"---18 versus 5 in our example but the ratio can be multiple orders of magnitude for large networks.

Today's template systems however, are far from perfect. While they reduce a class of errors, they do not help with deeper, logical bugs.
%, e.g., incorrect strategy for determining how announcements to a neighbor are forwarded
%, not realizing when or where aggregation should be used,
%and not understanding the interaction between configuration commands.
To author correct templates, engineers must still do themselves the conceptually challenging task of breaking down complex, global policies into role templates such that the collective behavior of the templates (upon compilation to configurations) correctly implements the policy under all failure conditions.

As a result, the types of configuration design errors in our example network pointed in prior work~\cite{propane} can occur in template design as well. For instance, to keep local prefixes internal the engineer may implement announcement forwarding on spines based on the identity of the neighbor, i.e., do not announce externally anything heard from local aggregators. This implementation works correctly when there are no failures but local prefixes can leak to the outside world when failures disconnect a spine from both aggregators in a local pod. Specifically, when S1 is disconnected from A5 and A6, it may hear about P5 and P6 from A3 and A4 (via A[5--6]->S2->A[3--4]), and it will then announce those prefixes outside (since they no not come from a local aggregator), leading to a policy violation. A correct implementation here would be for each spine to not advertise externally announcements from local aggregators {\em and} reject announcements that have traversed the other spine (i.e., disallow "valleys," or up-down-up paths).

Lacking correctness guarantees, engineers use simulations to analyze if templates are correct under a range of failure cases (e.g., combinations of two-link failures), but such analysis is highly expensive for large networks and still does not provide strong guarantees beyond the tested cases.

More importantly, because the analysis is done over a concrete topology, it provides no insight as to when the templates can be safely re-used. Templates that work for a given concrete topology may not work for seemingly-minor variations of the topology. Consider the network in Figure~\ref{fig:example2}, which is similar to Figure~\ref{fig:example}; it has the same folded-Clos structure and the same five roles. One might think that the same templates (but different database entries) can be used for both topologies. However, templates that disallow valley paths lead to a less fault-tolerant system for Figure~\ref{fig:example2}. 

In particular, aggregation-induced blackholes can occur in Figure~\ref{fig:example2} with only one link failure, while it would take two failures in Figure~\ref{fig:example}. Such blackholes occur when a switch announces an aggregate prefix but has no valid path to a more specific prefix within the aggregate. In Figure~\ref{fig:example}, a blackhole will occur when the link S1--A1 fails; after this failure, S1 has no valley-free path to P[1--2] even though it will continue to get traffic for these prefixes by virtue of announcing the encompassing aggregate PG. In contrast, in Figure~\ref{fig:example}, no such blackhole will occur after a single failure. 

Thus, engineers today must reason about the correctness of templates for each concrete topology and each evolution. Worse, for some evolutions, they may discover that their old templates will not work anymore and need modifications. This discovery is highly onerous because changing the templates implies that the configuration of all the devices needs to change, which can be an unacceptable disruption.  When that happens, many networks abandon templates entirely and revert to modifying individual configuration files, using localized patches to accomodate evolution. This reversion brings backs the class of errors that the templates were designed to prevent.

As an aside, a possible template implementation that works correctly for both networks is: allow valley paths and use an explicit list of local prefixes at spines to decide which announcements should not be forwarded externally.

\subsection{Challenges with concrete synthesis}

As an alternative approach to reduce configuration errors, the research community has developed many systems that take network topology and policy as input and output device configurations that are  guaranteed to be correct under all possible failures. Thus, they save the engineers from performing the complex task of breaking down global policies into device configurations.

However, they have two shortcomings, both stemming from operating over concrete topologies. The first is a mismatch in abstraction. Engineers that run large networks tend to think of them, and develop tools for them, in terms of roles and not individual devices. We have thus found that they are reluctant to use a system that does not understand roles as a first-order abstraction. There is no guarantee in these systems that the configurations of two devices that serve the same role will be "similar."  If the engineers wanted to sanity-check or (familiarize themselves with) their output, they'll have to consider all device configurations;  there can be orders of magnitude more devices than roles in the network.

A second shortcoming is lack of support for incremental growth. When engineers want to expand a network, they would have to input the new, planned topology to the system. The new configurations for existing devices may undergo unnecessary changes, beyond those needed to accommodate the expansion. For instance, suppose the engineers want to add another pod with local services to the network in Figure~\ref{fig:example}, and (like current aggregators) the aggregators in the new pod will connect to both spines. In this network, Propane, a concrete synthesis tool, uses prefix lists at spines to ensure that local prefixes are not advertised externally. To accommodate the expansion, the new spine configurations outputted by Propane will not only enable the interfaces that connect to the new aggregators but will also have to update the prefix list filters. A system that supports incremental growth should need only interface configuration changes (not filter changes). It can configure all local ToRs, including the new ones, to attach a tag to their announcements and filter external announcements at the spines based on this tag. Engineers prefer fewer configuration changes because each change runs the risks of poor transient behavior (which synthesis tools do not reason about).

\subsection{\sysnamesec} 

\sysname addresses the challenges above with both template systems and concrete synthesis tools. It takes as input network policy and an {\em abstract} topology  that captures the different device roles and connectivity. It outputs a template for each role. Engineers can then use \sysname's template compiler or their own to convert templates into configurations based on the concrete topology and parameter values. 

\sysname guarantees that the templates are correct, that is, when compiled to device configurations, the network will correctly implement the specified policy. These guarantees hold for any valid concrete topology that matches the specified abstract topology; and when a valid concrete topology evolves to another valid concrete topology, only necessary changes are needed to device configurations.

\subsection{Language}

Placeholder for formal language definition syntax + semantics

% Examples of code given below

%\sysname lets operators configure the network with the
%abstraction that they have centralized control over routing.
%Specifically, the operator simply provides a set of high-level constraints
%that describe the
%paths traffic should---or should not---take and their relative preferences.
%\sysname specifications are written modularly via a series
%of declarations.
%For example, to begin specification of the backbone
%network from the previous section, we first express the idea that
%we prefer that traffic leave the network through \CD{R1} over \CD{R2} (to \CD{Cust}) over \CD{Peer} over \CD{Prov} (policy P1 and P3 from Figure~\ref{fig:example1}):
%%
%\begin{code}
%\Define Prefs = \Exit(R1 \Prefer R2 \Prefer Peer \Prefer Prov)
%\end{code}
%This  statement defines a set of \emph{ranked paths}, which includes
%all paths (and only those paths) for which traffic exits our network
%through either router \CD{R1}, router \CD{R2}, \CD{Peer}, or \CD{Prov}.
%The paths that exit through \CD{R1}
%are preferred (\Prefer) to those that exit through \CD{R2}, which are preferred to those that
%leave through \CD{Peer} and then \CD{Prov}.  As we
%describe in the next section, the \Exit\ expression, as well as other
%path expressions used later in this section, is simply a shorthand for
%a particular regular expression over paths that is expressible in our policy
%language. The preference operator (\Prefer) is flexible and can be used between constraints as well as among individual routers. For example, the above constraint could have been written equivalently as
%\Exit(\CD{R1}) \Prefer \ldots \Prefer ~\Exit(\CD{Prov})%

%To associate ranked paths with
%one or more prefixes, we define a \sysname \emph{policy}.
%Within a policy, statements with the form $t\;$\Path$\;p$
%associate the prefixes defined by the predicate $t$ with the set of
%ranked paths defined by the path expression $p$.  In general,
%prefix predicates can be defined by arbitrary boolean combinations
%(and, or, not) of concrete prefixes and community tags.  Here,
%we assume we have already defined the predicate \CD{PCust} for the
%customer prefixes.
%%
%In the following code, ranked paths are associated with
%customer prefixes,
%and all other prefixes (\CD{true}). Policy statements are processed in
%order with earlier policy statements taking precedence over later
%policy statements. Hence, when the predicate \True{} follows
%the statement involving \CD{PCust}, it is interpreted as
%\CD{\True{} \AND{} \NOT{}PCust}.%
%

%\begin{code}
%\Define Routing =
%    \{PCust \Path Prefs \AND \End(Cust)
%     \True  \Path Prefs \}
%\end{code}
%\noindent%

%Line 2 of this policy
%restricts traffic destined to known customer prefixes (\CD{PCust}) to only follow paths that end at the customer. In addition, it enforces the network-wide preference that traffic leaves through \CD{R1} over \CD{R2} over \CD{Peer} over \CD{Prov}.
%%
%Line 3 applies to any other traffic not matching \CD{PCust} and allows the traffic to leave through any direct neighbor with the usual preference of \CD{R1} over \CD{R2} over \CD{Peer} over \CD{Prov}. To summarize our progress, the \CD{Routing} policy
%implements P1, P3, and P4 from Figure~\ref{fig:example1}.%
%

%Since, routing allows transit traffic by default (\EG, traffic entering from
%\CD{Peer} and leaving through \CD{Prov}), we separately define a
%policy to enforce P2 and P5 from Figure~\ref{fig:example1}, using conjunction (\AND),
%disjunction (\OR) and negation (\NOT) of constraints.
%First, we create reusable abstractions for describing traffic that transits our network. In \sysname, this is done by creating a new parameterized definition.
%\begin{code}
%\Define transit(X,Y) = \Enter(X{\OR}Y) \AND \Exit(X{\OR}Y)
%\Define cust-transit(X,Y) = \Later(X) \AND \Later(Y)
%\end{code}
%\noindent
%Here we define transit traffic between groups of neighbors $X$ and $Y$ as traffic that enters the network through some neighbor in $X$ or $Y$ and then also leaves the network through some neighbor in either $X$ or $Y$. Similarly, we define customer transit for customer $X$ and provider $Y$ as traffic that later goes through both $X$ and $Y$ after leaving our network. Using these two new abstractions, we can now implement policies P2 and P5 with the following constraint.%

%\begin{code}
%\Define NoTrans =
%  \{\True \Path \NOT{}transit(Peer,Prov) \AND
%           \NOT{}cust-transit(Cust,Prov)\}
%\end{code}
%\noindent
%The \CD{NoTrans} constraint requires that all traffic not follow a path that transits our network between \CD{Peer} and \CD{Prov}.
%Additionally, it prevents traffic from ever following paths that leave our network and later go through both \CD{Prov} and \CD{Cust}.  To implement both \CD{Routing}
%and \CD{NoTrans} simultaneously, we simply conjoin them: \CD{Routing \AND{} NoTrans}.%

%Collectively, the constraints above capture the entire policy. From them, our compiler will generate per-device import and export filters, local preferences,
%MED attributes, and community tags to ensure that the policy is
%implemented correctly under all failures.%
%

%Our datacenter example network has three main concerns:
%(1) traffic for the prefix allocated to each top-of-rack router must be able to reach that router,
%(2) local services must not leak outside the datacenter, and
%(3) aggregation must be performed on global prefixes to reduce churn
%in the network.%

%\sysname allows modular specification of each of these constraints. The first constraint is about prefix ownership---we want traffic only for certain prefixes to end up at a particular location. The following definition captures this intent.%
%

%\begin{code}
%\Define Ownership =
%    \{PG1 \Path \End(A)
%     PG2 \Path \End(B)
%     PL1 \Path \End(E)
%     PL2 \Path \End(F)
%     \True \Path \End(\Out)\}
%\end{code}
%\noindent
%This definition says that traffic for prefix \CD{PG1} is allowed to follow only paths that
%end at router \CD{A}; traffic for \CD{PG2},
%but not \CD{PG1}, must
%end at router \CD{B}; and so on.
%Any traffic destined for a prefix that is not a part of the datacenter should be allowed to leave the datacenter and end at some external location, which is otherwise unconstrained.
%The special keyword \Out{} matches any location outside the datacenter network, while the keyword \In{} will match any location inside the network.%

%For the second constraint, we define another policy:%

%\begin{code}
%\Define Locality =
%    \{PL1 \OR PL2 \Path \textbf{only}(\In)\}
%\end{code}

%%
%This definition says that traffic for local
%prefixes only follows paths that are internal to the network at each hop.
%This constraint guarantees that the services remain accessible only to locations
%inside the datacenter.%

%As in the backbone example, we can logically conjoin these constraints
%to specify the network-wide policy.
%However, in addition to constraints on the shape of paths,
%\sysname allows the operator to specify constraints on the BGP control plane itself.
%For instance, a constraint on aggregation is included to ensure that
%aggregation for global prefixes is performed from
%locations inside (\In) the network to locations outside (\Out).
%In this case, \CD{PG1} and \CD{PG2} will use the aggregate \CD{PG}
%(which we assume is defined earlier)
%when advertised outside the datacenter.%

%\begin{code}
%Ownership \AND{} Locality \AND{} \Agg(PG, \In \Link \Out)
%\end{code}%

%Once \sysname compiles the policy, it is guaranteed to remain compliant under all possible failure scenarios, modulo any aggregation-induced black holes. In the presence of aggregation, the \sysname compiler will also efficiently find a lower bound on the number of failures required to create an aggregation-induced black hole.

We borrow the intermediate graph-based representation from Propane:

\begin{easylist}[itemize]
& Show compilation from language to RIR

& Show compilation from RIR to Product Graph
&& Note that preferences are general, and it could potentially
   use any implementation (including SDN). But for the sake of
   simplicity, we will assume a BGP backend like Propane.
\end{easylist}

\section{Abstraction}
\label{sec:abstraction}

\begin{easylist}[itemize]
& Define abstractions more formally,
&& e.g., homomorphism between graphs + node/edge constraints
&& Use the datacenter example from before
&& First define the concretization function for translating the abstract policy
   into the concrete policy
&& Next, show the Product Graph for both the concrete and abstract policies.

& Show/Define safety analysis simulation relation for both concrete and abstract product graphs
  and how it holds for both.
&& Theorem: if safety analysis holdls in the abstract graph, it holds for the concrete one,
   and the preferences are consistent.

& Show/Define compilation to abstract BGP policies. Give concretization function,
  and compilation definition.

& Give abstraction theorem: commuting of concretization and compilation
\end{easylist}


%The examples above use what we call the front end (FE) of \sysname.
%It simplifies operators' task of describing preferred paths, but that simplicity comes at the cost of compilation complexity. The compiler must efficiently compute the sets of paths represented by the intersection of preferences and topology and ensure policy compliance under all failure scenarios.%

%  \label{fig:rir-syntax}
%  %\vspace{-1em}
%\end{figure*}%

%To handle these challenges, we decompose compilation into multiple stages, shown in  Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}, and develop efficient algorithms for the translation between stages. The first stage of the pipeline involves simple rewriting rules and substitutions from the FE to the core Regular Intermediate Representation (RIR). Policies in RIR are checked well-formedness (\EG, never constraining traffic that does not enter the network), before being combined with the topology to obtain the Product Graph Intermediate Representation (PGIR). The PGIR is a data representation that compactly captures the flow of BGP announcements subject to the policy and topology restrictions. We develop efficient algorithms that operate over the PGIR to ensure policy compliance under failures, avoid BGP instability, and prevent aggregation-induced black holes. Once the compiler determines safety, it translates the PGIR to an abstract BGP (ABGP) representation. ABGP can then be translated into various vendor-specific device
%configurations as needed.


%The \sysname FE is just a thin layer atop the RIR for describing preference-based path constraints.
%Figure~\ref{fig:rir-syntax} shows the RIR syntax. A policy has one or more constraints. The first kind of constraint is a test on the type of route and a corresponding set of preferred regular paths. Regular paths are regular expressions where the base characters are abstract locations representing either a router or an external AS. Special \In{} and \Out{} symbols refer to any internal or external location respectively. In addition, $\Sigma$ refers to any location. We also use the standard regular expression abbreviation $r^+$ for $r \cdot r^*$, a sequence of one or more occurrences of $r$. Predicates ($t$) consist of logical boolean connectives (and, or, not) as well as tests that match a particular prefix (or group of prefixes) and tests for route advertisements with a particular community value attached (\IE, an integer value associated with a path).%
%

%\sysname also supports constraints on the control-plane behavior of BGP. For example, prefix aggregation is an important optimization to reduce routing table size. A constraint of the form $agg(x,ln)$ tells the compiler to perform aggregation for prefix $x$ across all links described by $ln$. It is also often useful to be able to add community tags to exported routes in BGP (\EG, to communicate non-standard information to peers). A constraint of the form $tag(d,t,ln)$ adds community tag $d$ for any prefixes matching $t$ across links $ln$.
%%
%We list only the route aggregation and community tagging constraints in Figure~\ref{fig:rir-syntax}, but \sysname also supports other constraints such as limiting the maximum number of routes allowed between ASes, or enabling BGP multipath.


%\para{Semantics}

%We give a semantics to RIR programs using sets of ranked paths. Each path constraint $r_1 \Prefer \dots \Prefer r_j$ denotes a set of ranked network paths. A network path is a topologically valid string of abstract locations $l_1 l_2 \dots l_k$. We use the notation $\abs{p}$ to denote the length of the path $p$. A regular expression $r$ matches path $p$, if $p \in \mathcal{L}(r)$, that is, the path is in the language of the regular expression. Paths are ranked lexicographically according to (1) the most preferred regular expression matched, and (2) as a tie breaker, the path length. Lower ranks indicate \emph{more} preferred paths. More formally, a path $p$ has rank:
%$$(\min_i \set{ p \in \mathcal{L}(r_i) }, \abs{p})$$
%%
%The set of ranked paths depends on which paths are valid in the topology, and thus when failures occur, the most preferred routes change.
%%
%For any source $s$ and destination $d$, \sysname will send traffic along the highest ranked available path from $s$ to $d$.


%\para{From FE to RIR}

%The first stage in \sysname compilation reduces the FE to the simpler RIR from Figure~\ref{fig:rir-syntax}.
%The main differences between the FE and RIR are: $i)$ FE allows the programmer to specify constraints using a series of (modular) definitions, and combine them later, $ii)$ FE provides high-level names that abstract sets of routes and groups of prefixes/neighbors, and $iii)$ FE allows the preference operator to be used more flexibly.%

%A key constraint when translating FE to RIR is ensuring that all specified routes are well-formed. In particular, each regular path constraint $r$ must satisfy $r \subseteq \Out^* \cdot \In^+ \cdot \Out^*$. It ensures that users only control traffic that goes through their network at some point, and that such traffic does not loop back multiple times through their network.%

%The translation from FE to RIR is based on a set of rewriting rules.
%The first step merges separate constraints. It takes the cross product of per-prefix constraints, where logical conjunction ($r_1 ~\AND~ r_2$) is replaced by intersection on regular constraints ($r_1 \Intersect r_2$), logical disjunction is replaced by union, and logical negation ($\NOT r$) is replaced by path negation ($\Any \cap \NOT(r)$). The additional constraint $\Any$ ensures the routes are well-formed by restricting the paths to only those that go through the user's network.
%%
%For example, in the datacenter FE configuration from \S\ref{sec:propane}, combining the \CD{Locality} and \CD{Ownership} policies results in the following RIR:%

%\begin{code}
%PG1 \Path \End(A)
%PG2 \Path \End(B)
%PL1 \Path \textbf{only}(\In) \Intersect \End(E)
%PL2 \Path \textbf{only}(\In) \Intersect \End(F)
%\True \Path \Exit(\Out)
%\end{code}%

%The next step rewrites the high-level constraints such as $\Exit$ according to the equivalences in Figure~\ref{fig:rir-syntax}. Since preferences can only occur at the outermost level for an RIR expression, the final step is to ``lift" occurrences of the preference operator in each regular expression. For example, the regular expression $r \cdot (s ~\Prefer~ t) \cdot u$ is lifted to $(r \cdot s \cdot u) \Prefer (r \cdot t \cdot u)$ by distributing the preference over the sequence operator. In general, we employ the following distributivity equivalences:
%%
%\[
%\begin{array}{c}
%  r \odot (s_1 \Prefer \dots \Prefer s_n) = (r \odot s_1) \Prefer \dots \Prefer (r \odot s_n) \\
%  (s_1 \Prefer \dots \Prefer s_n) \odot r = (s_1 \odot r) \Prefer \dots \Prefer (s_n \odot r)
%\end{array}
%\]
%%
%where $\odot$ stands for an arbitrary regular binary operator, and $r$ is a policy with a single preference.
%%
%In cases where $r$ does not contain a single preference, such as $(s ~\Prefer~ t) \cdot (u ~\Prefer~ v)$, it is not clear which of the paths $s \cdot v$ or $t \cdot u$ is preferred. \sysname rejects such ambiguous policies, requiring instead that operators explicitly specify which paths to prefer --- for example as $(s \cdot u) ~\Prefer~ (s \cdot v) ~\Prefer~ (t \cdot u) ~\Prefer~ (t \cdot v)$.
%%
%Policies that contain preferences nested under a unary operator (\IE, \textit{star} or \textit{negation}) are also rejected by \sysname as invalid.

%\subsection{Product graph IR}

%Now that the user policy exists in a simplified form, we must consider the topology. In particular, we want a compact representation that describes all the possible ways BGP route announcements can flow through the network subject to the policy and topology constraints. The PGIR captures these constraints by ``intersecting" each of the regular automata corresponding to the RIR path preferences with the topology. Paths through the PGIR correspond to real paths through the topology that satisfy the user constraints.



%\para{Formal definition}

%While paths in an RIR policy describe the direction traffic flows through the network, to implement the policy with BGP we are concerned about the way control-plane information is disseminated --- route announcements flowing in the opposite direction. To capture this idea, for each regular expression $r_i$ in an RIR policy, we construct a deterministic finite state machine for the reversed regular expression. An automata for regular expression $r_i$ is defined as a tuple ($\Sigma, Q_i, F_i, q_{0_i}, \sigma_i$). The alphabet $\Sigma$ consists of all abstract locations (\IE, routers or ASes), $Q_i$ is the set of states for automaton i, $F_i$ is the set of final states, $q_{0_i}$ is the initial state, and $\sigma_i \colon Q_i \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q_i$ is the state transition function.
%%
%The topology is represented as a graph ($V, E$), which consists of a set of vertices $V$ and a set of directed edges $E \colon V \times V$.
%%
%The combined PGIR is a tuple ($V'$, $E'$, $s$, $e$, $P$) with
%vertices $V' \colon V \times Q_1 \times \dots \times Q_j$,
%edges $E' \colon V' \times V'$,
%a unique starting vertex $s$,
%a unique ending vertex $e$,
%and a preference function $P \colon V' \rightarrow 2^{\set{1, \dots, j}}$ , which maps nodes in the product graph to a set of path ranks.%

%For a PGIR vertex $n = (l, \dots) \in V'$, we say that $n$ is a \emph{shadow} of topology location $l$. We also write $\tilde{n} = l$ to indicate that the topology location for node $n$ is $l$. When two PGIR nodes $m$ and $n$ shadow the same topology location (\IE, $\tilde{m} = \tilde{n}$), we write $m \approx n$.%

%Throughout the remainder of the paper, we will use the convention that metavariables $m$ and $n$ stand for PGIR nodes and $l$ stands for a topology location. Capital letters like $X$ refer to concrete topology locations, while capital letters with subscripts such as $X_1$ and $X_2$ refer to concrete PGIR nodes that share a topology location (\IE, $\tilde{X_1}$ = $\tilde{X_2} = X$).

%\para{From RIR To PGIR}

%Let $a_i$ and $b_i$ denote states in the regular policy automata.
%The PGIR is constructed by adding an edge from $m = (l_m, a_1, \dots, a_k)$ to $n = (l_n, b_1, \dots, b_k)$ whenever $\sigma_i(a_i, l_n) = b_i$ for each $i$ and $(l_m,l_n) \in E$ is a valid topology link.
%%
%Additionally, we add edges from the start node $s$ to any $n = (l, a_1, \dots, a_k)$ when $\sigma_i(q_{0_i}, l) = a_i$ for each $i$.
%%
%The preference function $P$ is defined as $P(n) = \set{i~\vert~a_i \in F_i} $. That is, it records the path rank of each automaton that has reached a final state.
%%
%Finally, there is an edge from each node in the PGIR such that $P(n) \neq \emptyset$ to the special end node $e$. We write $(m \leq_{rank} n)$ if either $P(m) = P(n) = \emptyset$ or $min ~ P(m) \leq min ~ P(n)$, which means that paths ending at PGIR node $m$ are better (lower rank) than paths ending at $n$.%
%

%Intuitively, the PGIR tracks the policy states of each automaton as route announcements move between locations.
%%
%Consider the topology in Figure~\ref{fig:example-compilation}. Suppose we want a primary route from neighbor W that allows traffic to enter the network at $A$ and utilize the C--D link before leaving the network (through $X$ or $Y$). As a backup, we also want to allow traffic to enter the network from $B$, in which case the traffic can also utilize the C--E link before leaving the network. For simplicity, we assume that the route ends in either $X$, $Y$, or $Z$. The RIR for the policy could be written as:
%%
%$$(\CD{W} \cdot \CD{A} \cdot \CD{C} \cdot \CD{D} \cdot \Out) \Prefer (\CD{W} \cdot \CD{B} \cdot \In^+ \cdot \Out)$$
%%
%Figure~\ref{fig:example-compilation} shows the policy automata for each regular expression preference. Since we are interested in the flow of control messages, the automata match backwards.
%%
%The figure also shows the PGIR after intersecting the topology and policy automata. Every path in the PGIR corresponds to a concrete path in the topology. In particular, every path through the PGIR that ends at a node $n$ such that the preference function $P(n) = \set{i_1, \dots, i_k}$ is non-empty, is a valid topological path that satisfies the policy constraints and results in a particular path with preferences $i_1$ through $i_k$.
%%
%For example, the path $X \cdot D \cdot C \cdot A \cdot W$ is a valid path in the topology that BGP route announcements might take, which would lead to obtaining a path with the lowest (best) rank of $1$.
%BGP control messages can start from peer X, which would match the $\Out$ transition from both automata, leading to state $1$ in the first automaton, and state $1$ in the second automaton. This possibility is reflected in the product graph by the node with state $(X,1,1)$. From here, if X were to advertise this route to D, it would result in the path $D \cdot X$, which would lead to state $2$ in the first automaton, and state $2$ in the second automaton, and so on.
%%
%The ``--" state indicates the corresponding automaton cannot accept the current path or any extension of it. Since
%node $(W,5,-)$ is in an accepting state for the first automaton, it indicates that this path has rank 1.



%\subsection{Failure-safety analysis}

%To implement path preferences in routing, BGP uses local preferences on a per-device basis. However, the distributed nature of BGP makes setting preferences locally to achieve a network-wide routing policy difficult. This task becomes even more challenging in the presence of failures since routers running BGP lack a global view of the network.

%\para{An illustrative example}

%To demonstrate the difficulty of generating device-local preferences, consider the simple policy for the topology in Figure~\ref{fig:unimplementable}, which says to prefer the top path over the bottom path:
%%
%$(\CD{A} \cdot \CD{B} \cdot \CD{D} \cdot \CD{E} \cdot \CD{G})  \Prefer (\CD{A} \cdot \CD{C} \cdot \CD{D} \cdot \CD{F} \cdot \CD{G})$.
%%
%How could such a policy be implemented in BGP? Suppose we set the local preferences to have $D$ prefer $E$ over $F$, and have $A$ prefer $B$ over $C$. This works as expected under normal conditions, however, if the A--B link fails, then suddenly $D$ has made the wrong decision by preferring $E$. Traffic will now follow the
%$A \cdot C \cdot D \cdot E \cdot G$ path, even though this path was not allowed by the policy. Thus, the distributed implementation has used a route that is not allowed by the policy. To make matters worse, the second preference for the path $A \cdot C \cdot D \cdot F \cdot G$ is available in the network but not being used. Thus, a path for the best possible route available after the A--B failure exists in the network, but the distributed implementation will not find it.
%%
%The first problem could be fixed by tagging and filtering route advertisements appropriately so that $C$ rejects routes that go through $E$, however the second problem cannot be fixed. In fact, this policy cannot be implemented in BGP in a way that is policy compliant under all failures since $D$ cannot safely choose between $E$ and $F$ without knowing whether the A--B link is available.


%\para{Problem formulation}

%The problem of determining local preferences for each router is reflected in the structure of the PGIR. Whenever a given router appears as multiple shadow nodes in the PGIR, the compiler must decide which shadow to prefer.
%%
%In the example from Figure~\ref{fig:example-compilation}, the topology node $C$ can receive an advertisement from $E$ in shadow $(C,-,2)$ or from $D$ in shadow $(C,3,2)$.
%%
%%
%The compiler must determine a \emph{total ordering} of shadow nodes for each router, which reflects the relative preference of advertisements received in each shadow and should be consistent with path ranks.
%%
%For example, if $C$'s shadow $(C,3,2)$ can be preferred to $(C,-,2)$, written as $(C,3,2) \leq_{lp} (C,-,2)$, $C$ can prefer advertisements from $(D,2,2)$ over $(E,-,2)$. $D$ and $E$ tag their advertisements to let $C$ know which shadow sent the advertisement. Section \ref{sec:abgp} discusses tagging in detail.

%  \label{fig:unimplementable}
%  %\vspace{-1em}
%\end{figure}



%\para{Regret-free preferences}

%To order PGIR shadows ($\leq_{lp}$) for each router in a way that is policy-compliant under all failures, we introduce the notion of \emph{regret-free} preferences, motivated by the observations from the example in Figure~\ref{fig:unimplementable}. A router (location) $l$ has a regret-free preference for a set of advertisements $A$ over $B$ if, whenever $l$ selects an advertisement to destination $d$ from $A$ over another from $B$, there is always some policy-compliant path to $d$ that is at least as good ($\leq_{rank}$ for the final node along the path) as any possible path (not necessarily from $l$) to $d$ if $l$ had selected an advertisement from $B$ instead. In other words, the preference of $A$ over $B$ at $l$ is regret-free if $l$ is never (under any failure) worse-off by choosing an advertisement from $A$ when available. The notion of regret-free preferences can be lifted to PGIR nodes by considering the set of advertisements available to each node.%

%In the example of Figure~\ref{fig:example-compilation}, the choice for $C$ to prefer shadow $(C,3,2)$ to $(C,-,2)$ is regret-free, since there will always be at least as good a path to destination $W$ regardless of any failures that might occur in the network. For example, if the $C$--$A$ link fails, then there is still a backup path from $(C,3,2)$ to $(W,-,4)$ that is just as good as any path from $(C,-,2)$. Likewise, any combination of failures to disconnect $(C,3,2)$ from $(W,-,4)$ would also disconnect $(C,-,2)$ from $(W,-,4)$.


%\para{A preference inference algorithm}


%Searching for precise regret-free preferences in general is hard, and clearly enumerating all possible combinations of failures and preference orderings is intractable. We thus adopt a conservative analysis that we found to be effective and efficient in practice. The idea is to $i)$ search for regret-free preferences by comparing the set of paths available after accepting advertisements in two different PGIR shadows $N_1$ and $N_2$ of topology node $N$, and $ii)$ refine the comparison when necessary by considering where the announcements must have traversed before arriving at $N_1$ or $N_2$.

%Algorithm~\ref{alg:failures} checks whether one shadow can be preferred to another ($N_1 \leq_{lp} N_2$). It walks from nodes $N_1$ and $N_2$ and ensures that for every \textit{step} $N_2$ can take to some new topology location, $N_1$ can, at the very least, also take a step to an equivalent topology location $(\approx)$. When there is no such equivalent step, the algorithm attempts to take into account where the advertisement must have already traversed. In particular, it checks if there is an equivalent dominator node and, if so, walks from this new node instead.
%%
%The idea is that, since the advertisement must have already passed through the dominator, we can check to see if we are guaranteed to find paths that are at least as good from this new node instead.
%%
%At each step, it requires that the current node reachable from $N_1$ has a path rank that is at least as good as that of the current node reachable from $N_2$ ($m \leq_{rank} n$). The intuition here is that if $m \nleq_{rank} n$, then we can very likely fail every edge in the topology except for the path that leads to the current $m$ and $n$, thereby generating a counterexample.
%Algorithm~\ref{alg:failures} terminates since the number of related states $(m,n)$ that can be explored is finite.%

%For each router in the topology, local preferences are now obtained by sorting the corresponding PGIR shadows according to the $(\leq_{lp})$ relation determined by Algorithm~\ref{alg:failures}. If two nodes are incomparable, then the compiler rejects the policy as unimplementable.



%\para{Avoiding loops}

%The checks for failure safety described above overlook one critical point: A better (lower rank) path might not be available due to loops rejected by BGP.%

%Consider the partial product graph shown in Figure~\ref{fig:avoiding-loops}. Our preference inference algorithm will determine that node $X_1$ should be locally preferred to node $X_2$ since this will result in a better (lower ranked) path to destination $A$. However, when applying Algorithm~\ref{alg:failures}, we failed to take into account the possibility of loops. In particular, node $A_2$ may be unusable for advertisements that go through $X_1$ since the advertisement may have already gone through $A_1$ previously. In this case, $X$ will have made the wrong choice since preferring $X_2$ would have resulted in a better path for the destination $A$ (a path of rank 3 instead of 4).%

%On the other hand, this would not have been a problem if paths ending at $A_1$ had a lower rank than those ending at $A_2$ or $A_3$. For example, if paths ending at $A_1$ had rank 1, then any time $A_2$ is unusable due to a loop with $A_1$, it ultimately does not matter since $A_1$ is preferred anyway.
%%
%In fact, checking if we are never worse off using $A_1$ instead of $A_2$ corresponds exactly with determining if $A$ has a regret-free preference for $A_1$ over $A_2$.
%%
%More specifically, the compiler checks that, any time there are two shadows $N_1$ and $N_2$ for the same topology location, where $N_1$ appears ``above'' (\IE, can reach) $N_2$ in the PGIR, then $N_1$ must be strictly preferred to $N_2$ (\IE, $N_1 <_{lp} N_2$).

%\subsection{Aggregation-safety analysis}
%\label{sec:agg-safety}

%As shown in \S\ref{sec:motivation}, aggregation can lead to subtle black-holing of traffic when failures occur. Determining when this can happen requires knowledge, not only of the topology, but also of the policy. For instance, a policy might require that all traffic for a particular prefix go over a single link before being aggregated. If that one link fails, a black hole might be introduced.
%%
%Because the PGIR encodes the complete user policy and topology, \sysname can efficiently check that aggregates do not black hole traffic for up to $k$ failures.%

%We view the aggregation problem as a variant of the min-cut problem in the PGIR. Specifically, for each prefix that falls under an aggregate, we are interested in finding a lower bound on the number of failures required to disconnect the prefix's origin from its aggregation point. The difficulty, however, is that each link in the topology might appear as multiple links in the PGIR, thus preventing the direct application of standard min-cut algorithms.
%%%

%Instead, we adopt the following simple strategy: $i)$ pick a random path in the PGIR between the prefix's origin and aggregation point, $ii)$ remove all similar edges in the PGIR for each topology edge along the chosen path, and $iii)$ repeat until no such path exists.
%Because each path chosen is both policy compliant and edge disjoint (due to ii), the number of paths that we are able to remove lower bounds the number of failures required to disconnect the prefix from its aggregate, subject to the policy constraints.%
%

%Recall the datacenter example from \S\ref{sec:motivation}, with the policy
%\CD{PG1} \Path \text{ }\End(\CD{A}), where \CD{PG1} falls under the \CD{PG} aggregate. Figure~\ref{fig:aggregation-safety} shows the PGIR for \CD{PG1}. Since we know aggregation will occur at $X$, and that the \CD{PG1} prefix will originate at $A$, we can compute the number of failures it would take to disconnect $A$ from $X$. We could remove the $A$--$D$--$X$ path first and would then need to remove any other $A$--$D$ or $D$--$X$ links from the PGIR (in this case none). Next, we could remove the links along the $A$--$C$--$X$ path, repeating the process. Because $A$ is now disconnected from $X$, 2 is a lower bound on the number of failures required to introduce an aggregation black hole for prefix \CD{PG1}. This process is repeated for other aggregation locations (\EG, $Y$).

%Our work draws on four threads of prior work.%

%\para{Topology abstraction}%

%\para{Topology design}%

%\para{Configuration automation}
%Many practitioners use configuration templates~\cite{hatch,thwack}, to ensure certain kinds of consistency across similar devices. In addition, configuration languages such as RPSL~\cite{RFC2622}, Yang~\cite{RFC6020}, and Netconf~\cite{RFC6241} allow operators to express routing policy in a vendor-neutral way.
%However, all of these solutions remain low-level, for example, requiring operators to specify exact local preferences. Unlike \sysname, there is no guarantee that these low-level configurations satisfy the original, high-level intent.%

%\para{Configuration analysis}
%The notion that configuring network devices is difficult and error-prone is not new.
%In the past, researchers have tried to tackle this problem by analyzing existing
%router configurations~\cite{feamster+:rcc,ipassure,batfish,bagpipe,arc} and reporting errors or inconsistencies when they are detected.
%Our research is complementary to these analysis
%efforts.  We hope to eliminate bugs by using higher-level
%languages and a ``correct-by-construction''
%methodology. Writing configurations at a high level of abstraction simplifies policy implementation and prevents a whole host of low-level errors.%

%\para{Configuration synthesis}
%ConfigAssure~\cite{narain:lisa05,narain+:configassure}
%is another system designed to
%help users define and debug low-level router
%configurations.  Inputs to
%ConfigAssure include a \emph{configuration database}, which contains a
%collection of tuples over constants and configuration variables, and a
%\emph{requirement}, which is a set of constraints.
%%
%The authors use a combination of logic programming and
%SAT solving to find concrete values for configuration variables.
%ConfigAssure handles configuration for a wide range of protocols and many
%different concerns.  In contrast, the scope of \sysname is much
%narrower.  In return, \sysname offers compact, higher-level
%abstractions customized for our domain, such as regular paths, as well
%as domain-specific analyses customized to those abstractions, such as
%our failure safety analysis.  The implementation technology is also
%entirely different, as we define algorithms over automata and graphs
%as opposed to using logic programming and SAT-based model-finding.

%\subsection{Propane Properties}
%
%\newtheorem{prop}{Proposition}[section]
%
%Here we investigate the correctness and expressiveness properties of \sysname. We are mainly concerned with answering the following questions: (1) does the distributed, compiled policy faithfully implement the user's policy regardless of failures? (2) Are the resulting BGP configurations stable?, and (3) what polcies are or are not expressible in \sysname?
%
%If \sysname compiles a user policy to a distributed implementation, then that distributed implementation faithfully meets the centralized policy's semantics under any failure scenario. We are primarily concerned with the steady state: that is, what happens after (if) the routing protocol converges. We argue that \sysname is correct by breaking down the claim:
%
%\begin{prop}
%BGP configurations for internal routers produced by \sysname will be stable.
%\end{prop}
%
%\begin{prop}
%BGP configurations produced by \sysname are \textit{Sound} with respect to the policy: That is, any route traffic takes in the network, is a valid route specified by the policy.
%\end{prop}
%
%The Soundness claim follows directly from compilation of the product graph. Since every path through the product graph (from start to end) must match the user's policy, and since the compiled configurations use communities to ensure only valid routes through the product graph are used, the resulting BGP configurations are Sound.
%
%\begin{prop}
%BGP configurations produced by \sysname are \textit{Complete}: That is, the distributed implementation always obtains a most preferred route between two nodes when the corresponding path exists in the network.
%\end{prop}
%
%The argument for completeness is as follows: Assume the most preferred path that exists in the network is between two nodes $X$ and $Y$.  This means there is a valid path in the product graph corresponding to this path, and which is available in the network.
%Assume we are unable to achieve this route in the network. To not achieve this path means that some router along the advertisement route from $Y$ to $X$ preferred to accept an advertisement from another peer instead. This implies that router that makes the ``wrong'' choice appears as a separate node in the product graph. However, from our failure safety check, we know that the other, more-preferred node must have a superset of the paths to accepting states as the less preferred node (from which it stole the route) for at least as good of a final preference. The argument then proceeds by induction on the path length - there are only a finite number of such stealings that can occur, each of which will ultimately still result in a route advertisement reaching $X$ along a most preferred path.
%
%Any \sysname-compiled policy will be \textit{Complete} as a result of the failure safety check.
%

%

%The combination of Soundness and Completeness ensures that the distributed implementation will always send traffic along the best paths possible, yet will also never also use any undesired paths. These properties rely on the fact that \sysname produces stable BGP configurations:

%
%The reduction is via the well-known No-Dispute-Wheel condition~\ref{bib:todo} for stable BGP. In particular, any policy with a dispute wheel will not pass the stronger failure safety check by \sysname.
%
%\begin{figure}[t!]
%\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/dispute-wheel}
%\label{fig:dispute-wheel}
%\caption{Product graph for a dispute wheel.}
%\end{figure}
%
%The reduction is via the well-known No-Dispute-Wheel condition~\ref{bib:todo}. If a set of BGP configurations do not have a dispute wheel, then they will converge to their best routes. Any BGP policy with a dispute wheel will not satisfy the failure safety condition in Section~\ref{sec:compilation}. Assume that the preferences in the policy describe a dispute wheel, and we will show that our failure check will reject the policy. Informally, a dispute wheel occurs when there are some number of nodes $u_1, \dots, u_n$ attempting to get a path to a destination node $d$. Each node $u_i$ prefers to go through its neighbor $u_{i+1}$ over route $R_i$ than directly to $d$ with route $Q_i$. Thus the nodes form a wheel of preferences. The product graph for a policy that contains a dispute wheel will look like Figure~\ref{fig:dispute-wheel}, which shows a dispute wheel of size 3. In order to pass the failure safety check for the compiler, the more-preferred node for $u_2$ will need to have a superset of the paths starting from the less-preferred node for $u_2$. In turn, this means that the maximum length path after visiting the more preferred $u_2$ will be $max(Z) = 1 + max(Y)$, similarly, if we look at $u_1$, we will determine that $max(Y) = 1 + max(X)$, and so on. The resulting equations define a system of unsatisfiable equations. Therefore, it is not possible for \sysname to compile a BGP policy that contains a dispute wheel. Since no-dispute-wheel is a sufficient condition for BGP stability, any compiled \sysname policy will be stable.
%

%An important distinction is that BGP might still be instable with respect to other external ASes, since \sysname has no way of configuring their routing policy and can only rely on AS path filters to see what advertisements are observed.
