\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Environments: Model environments using the same framework. (e.g., no-export allows certain paths that weren't before
	\item Verification: (Language serves as a high-level abstraction of the low-level details, so we can perform verification directly on the high-level policies)
	\item OSPF: language isn't inherently tied to BGP, and could use iBGP with OSPF or some other protocol. This would require different kinds of checks though.
\end{itemize}
