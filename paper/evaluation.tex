\section{Evaluation}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Expressiveness of the policy language / BGP safe part of the language (maybe a proof earlier for this)
	\item Compactness of the policy language (how verbose/concise, maybe in loc)
	\item Intuitiveness of the policy language (how easy is it to understand? Not really a good way to evaluate this other than demonstrate earlier by example)
	\item Speed of compilation (does it take forever? what are the bottlenecks)
	\item Understandability of the resulting configurations (Can humans understand them?)
	\item Some measure of the size of the resulting configurations (e.g., the number of route maps. Is this actually ever an issue in BGP?)
\end{enumerate}
