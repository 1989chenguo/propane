\textbf{Abstract---}
Networks are notoriously difficult to configure correctly. Operators typically rely on local configuration of individual devices running distributed control plane protocols to achieve network-wide objectives. The complexity of this task is made greater still by the fact that operators must forsee and protect against failures in the network.
%
The recent move towards Software-defined networking has been, in part, motivated by the simplicity of the centralized model -- where a controller directly manages individual devices rather than letting them manage themselves. However distributed protocols have many important advantages over a the completely centralized approach, including scalability, latency, and fault tolerance.
%
In this paper, we describe a new system -- \sysname, which allows an operator to declaratively specify a high-level centralized routing policy, but then compile it to a purely distributed implementation, leveraging the BGP routing protocol to run on existing, commodity hardware. 
%
Propane allows operators to describe the types of paths traffic may (or may not) take through the network, as well as relative preferences (or backups) between paths. 
%
Network policies compiled with \sysname are guaranteed to implement the correct routing policy in a distributed fashion regardless of any number of failures that may occur in the network. 
%
\sysname also takes the centralized model one step further by unifying inter and intra-domain routing. Operators can specify routing policy for an autonomous system by programming against the abstraction that they can control any route in the wider internet.
%
We have implemented a compiler for \sysname and evaluated it against several real-world configurations for data centers and core backbone networks. The current \sysname compiler can scale to relatively large topologies with thousands of routers.
