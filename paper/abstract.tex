\textbf{Abstract---}
Configuring networks correctly with distributed protocols while simultaneously meeting network-wide objectives is difficult and error-prone in practice.

The recent shift towards Software-defined networking has been, in part, motivated by the simplicity of the centralized model -- where a controller directly manages individual devices rather than letting them manage themselves. However distributed protocols have many important advantages over a completely centralized model, including scalability and fault tolerance.
%
In this paper, we describe a new system -- \sysname, which allows an operator to declaratively specify a high-level centralized routing policy, but then compile it to a purely distributed implementation, leveraging the BGP routing protocol to run on commodity hardware. 
%
Propane allows users to describe the types of paths traffic may take through the network, as well as relative preferences (or backups) between paths. 
%
Network policies compiled with \sysname are guaranteed to implement the correct routing policy regardless of any number of failures that may occur in the network. 
%
In addition, \sysname takes the centralized model further by unifying inter and intra-domain routing. Operators can specify routing policy for an autonomous system by programming against the abstraction that they can control any route in the wider internet.
%
We have implemented a compiler for \sysname and evaluated it against several real-world configurations for data centers and core backbone networks. The current \sysname compiler can scale to relatively large topologies with thousands of routers.
